						Doraemon, a cat robot from the 22nd century, is sent to take care of Nobita Nobi by Sewashi Nobi, Nobita's future grandson, so that his descendants can get a better life. At the present, Nobita is a man who always fails in class, and whose company goes bankrupt, causing his family and sons to face financial difficulties.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most stories of Doraemon revolve the young Nobita Nobi, who receives poor grades and is frequently bullied by his two classmates, Takeshi Goda (nicknamed "Gian") and Suneo Honekawa (Gian's sidekick). Doraemon has a four-dimensional pouch in which he stores unexpected gadgets he uses to aid Nobita. Doraemon's gadgets help Nobita overcome the troubles, and they end up developing a relationship with each other.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nobita's closest friend and love interest is Shizuka Minamoto, who eventually becomes his wife in the future.[a] Gian and Suneo often bully Nobita, but are also shown as Nobita's friends in certain episodes, and especially in the movies. A typical story consists of Nobita taking a gadget from Doraemon for his needs eventually making problems worse than they initially were.
					</p>

						<li id="nobi"><h2>Nobita Nobi</h2></li>
						<p>
							Nobita's characterization depicts him as an incompetent and flawed person, including but not limited to a lack of physical co-ordination or athletic talent, predisposition to laziness, reluctance to engage in critical thinking, and sometimes exhibits childish or even perverted behavior. He dislikes books and lacks a basic grasp of scientific knowledge, being unable to understand concepts such as the definition of an eclipse. He often takes any chance to take a nap and favors gadgets that provide convenience, and is often known as 'The Lazy King'. Whenever he possesses Doraemon's gadgets, he shows them off to his classmate and future love interest Shizuka but not to his other schoolmates Suneo and Gian. He envies Dekisugi, who is good at everything and admired by Shizuka. Nobita's typical day consists of arriving late to school, falling asleep during class, scoring low marks on his tests, getting scolded by his teacher and teased by Gian and Suneo, falling in the curbside rain gutters, getting chased by dogs after stepping on them accidently, getting scolded by his mother for not completing his tasks, and being bullied by people he knows except Shizuka.
						</p>
						<li id="sizu"><h2>Shizuka Minamoto</h2></li>
						<p>
							Shizuka is a smart and kind neighbourhood girl, and, unlike Nobita, a quick-witted and very studious child.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unlike Nobita, Suneo, and Gian, she is not a fan of video games, but she does like games like Pink Bubble (spoof of Kirby's Dreamland) and Dino World (spoof of Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island).
						</p>
						<p>
							She cares for weaker people, abused animals, and neglected dolls. She wishes to be a nurse or an air-hostess when she grows up. Both jobs reflect her kind nature. Shizuka loves her dolls a lot, to the extent that she loves them more than her own friends. She once freed a little bird from a bundle of strings it got caught in. She also cares deeply for the Grandfather Tree, as when she was unable to save the Grandfather Tree, she was devastated but later felt relieved when she saw a little sprout from the Grandfather Tree stump. In one episode, Doraemon, Nobita and Shizuka put her dolls in Nobita's race cars and started racing. Nobita's car crashed and the doll fell out, making Shizuka cry and get angry at him for a little while. But when she sees Nobita doing the right thing or a good thing for others, it would be enough to make her genuinely forgive Nobita.
						</p>
						<li id="dore"><h2>Doraemon</h2></li>
						<p>
							Doraemon is considered a substandard product because many of his robotic features (i.e. radar whiskers and cat-calling bell) malfunctioned after production due to an accident in the factory while he was being built. Due to this malfunction, Doraemon did not do well at the robot's school and during the final presentation show, he performed badly and nobody wanted to hire him, until baby Sewashi pushed the button. His parents were a bit reluctant, but since Sewashi liked him, they hired Doraemon, and he took care of him until Sewashi himself sent him to the past to take care of Nobita. Despite this, Doraemon shows a lot of intelligence and common sense. Whenever he hangs out with his friend Mii-Chan (a cute street cat), he calls it 'important and busy work' as excuses for not doing work when Nobita or his mother ask him to do something when he will be going out with Mii. As a robot, Doraemon can be shut down if his balloon tail is pulled.
						</p>
						<p>
							Doraemon's favourite food is dorayaki (どら焼き) (known as "fudgy pudgy pie" in the English version of the manga, "yummy buns" in the English, and "dora-cakes/bean jam buns" in other versions), a Japanese treat filled with red bean paste. While it might explain the origin of his name, it was revealed in one of the manga chapters that his name originates from the Japanese word nora neko (のら猫) for "stray cat", and the -emon (衛門) ending which is part of traditional Japanese names, as seen also in, for example, Ishikawa Goemon. Doraemon is also appeared in Perman series as Mitsuo's friend.
						</p>
						<p>
							He Has Many Gadgets. Some Of Them Are : 
						</p>
						<dl><ul>
							<li id="time"><dt>Time Cloth</dt></li>
							<dd>Wrap it around any object or living things and depending on which side you use, you can either get a younger, brand-new version or its older, deteriorating counterpart.</dd>
							<li id="take"><dt>Take-copter</dt></li>
							<dd>Take-copter came from the words taketombo (Japanese word for bamboo-copter) and helicopter. In several Doraemon episodes, takecopter was shown as a head accessory which uses mind control to propel itself in the air. You can use the tiny suction cup to attach the propeller to your head or any parts of the body. Although your thoughts determine its destination, take-copter has a limited battery supply which only lasts for 8 hours.</dd>
							<li id="anyw"><dt>The ‘Anywhere’ Door</dt></li>
							<dd>Just tell your dream destination and this magic door will do the trick. Whether it’s the Machu Picchu or a planet that is 100, 000 light years away from Earth, the ‘anywhere’ door will make sure you land to the right location. It only connects two different locations, though, so make sure you visit places one at a time.</dd>
							<li id="prin"><dt>3D Printer</dt></li>
							<dd>This lovely printer can literally convert your drawings into real, life-sized versions. In other words, your imagination is the limit. Once you have an idea in mind (say your dream house), you can then draw it out on a piece of paper. Put the paper diagram on the slit located on the middle portion of the printer. The data will then pass through a tube, a compressor, and finally an exit hole where you’ll get what you wished for.</dd>
							<li id="memo"><dt>Memory Bread</dt></li>
							<dd>Place it against your school notes, a page of a book, or anything else that contains data you want to memorize. A special mechanism enables this bread to fully absorb all the information written on a page. You can then eat the bread on your breakfast and voilà, you’re one step closer to that perfect test score!</dd>

						<li id="gian"><h2>Takeshi Gian Goda</h2></li>
						<p>
							Voiced by: Kaneta Kimotsuki (1973), Kazuya Tatekabe (1979 – March 2005), Subaru Kimura (2005–present), Kujira (2000; Teen) (Japanese); Gerald Chew]] (2002-2003), Kaiji Tang (2014-2015) (English)
						</p>
						<p>
							Takeshi Goda (剛田 武, Gōda Takeshi) (born on 15 June, [b] Gemini), named Buster in the Cinar dub and Bob in the Speedy dub, usually known by the nickname "Giant" (「ジャイアン」, "Jaian", English: Big G), is a strong and quick-tempered local bully. He also frequently steals other children's stuff (especially Nobita's and Suneo's) under the pretext of "borrowing" them, unless the toy is damaged. He is known for his awful singing voice, though he considers himself a great singer. To prove this, Giant sometimes "invites" others to attend his concerts, under the threat of beatings. His singing is so horrible that, once, Nobita and Doraemon try to mute it in a silent world, his writings of the song lyrics in a board end up having the same effect as when they hear them. In some films, his singing is enhanced to become an effective weapon (as in 'Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas'). In some episodes when his voice is recorded and he hears it, he instantly denies it being his voice and threatens to beat up the person who sang his songs in a very bad way (which is an irony). Gian is also confident in cooking, but just like his singing, his hand-made food can be a nightmare for other people very easily.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, Giant does not hesitate to help his friends when they are in real trouble. Throughout the series, particularly the films, he is often the one who voices the most concern and refuses to look away when there is a problem, an opposite of Suneo's cowardice. While he is described by others as daunting and intimidating, he is very sensitive and prone to crying when something touching happens, and he actually values his friends highly, a feeling which his friends sometimes reciprocate. Gian also has a soft spot for his younger sister, Jaiko, and usually tries to prevent her from trouble, even if she can perfectly handle her situation.
						</p>
						<p>
							His catchphrase is "What's mine is mine. What's yours is also mine." (「俺の物は、俺の物。お前の物も俺の物。」, "Ore no mono wa, ore no mono. Omae no mono mo ore no mono."), also known as Gianism (ジャイアニズム, Jaianizumu) in Japan (the Japanese band Nightmare have borrowed the term for their albums Gianism Best Ofs and Gianizm).
						</p>
						<li id="sune"><h2>Suneo Honekawa</h2></li>
						<p>
							Voiced by: Shun Yashiro (1973), Kaneta Kimotsuki (1979 – March 2005), Naoki Tatsuta (stand-in for Kimotsuki), Tomokazu Seki (April 2005 – present) (Japanese); Hossan Leong (2002-2003), Brian Beacock (2014-2015) (English)
						</p>
						<p>
							Suneo Honekawa (骨川 スネ夫, Honekawa Suneo, English dub: Ricky in the Cinar dub, Tim or Timmy in the Speedy dub, and Sneech in the Bang Zoom! dub) (born on 28 February,[c] Pisces) is the fox-faced (inherited from his mother) rich child who loves to flaunt his material wealth before everyone, especially Nobita. A lot of the stories start with Suneo showing off some new video game, toy or pet which evokes Nobita's envy. He is often seen with Gian, teasing Nobita. He sometimes despises Nobita and often makes fun of him, most often resulting in Nobita getting into trouble. He also often pushes Nobita aside with silly excuses while he invites Gian and Shizuka to his parties or resorts. However, he is actually one of Nobita's closest friends, who would often ask for his and Doraemon's help. In the films, Suneo is often the one most reluctant to take part in Nobita and Doraemon's adventures, and he also tries to face as little trouble as possible and go home, unless others convince him, making him somewhat a coward. He has an extensive knowledge of science, and is a talented artist and designer, besides being extremely cunning.
						</p>
						<p>
							In some scenes, Suneo is seen as a narcissist who loves to stare at himself in the mirror while telling himself that he is the most handsome guy in the world. His habit of bragging often lands him into trouble. Suneo is also very self-conscious about his height, being the shortest kid in his class. He likes steak and melon. There are many reasons why Suneo chooses Shizuka and Gian, except Nobita. It is because he tries to win Shizuka's favour and not to get harmed by Gian.
						</p>
						<li id="dora"><h2>Dorami</h2></li>
						<p>
							Voiced by: Keiko Yokozawa (1980–2005), Chiaki Fujimoto (2006–present) (Japanese); Wendee Lee (2014-2017) (English)
						</p>
						<p>
							Dorami (ドラミ) (born on 2 December 2114, Sagittarius) is Doraemon's younger sister. Like Doraemon before he developed a fear of mice, she is yellow-skinned and has ears that resemble a large red bow. She and Doraemon are siblings due to the fact that they shared half of the oil from a can. Dorami lives in the 22nd-century Tokyo with Sewashi. She sometimes visits Nobita with a time machine when Doraemon is "off-duty", to help Doraemon with something or to take care of Nobita when Doraemon has gone for his yearly health checkup. Dorami likes melonpan and is afraid of cockroaches like Nobita's mom. She is also shown to be a more advanced robot than Doraemon (Dorami is able to produce 10,000 horse power, in comparison to Doraemon's 129.3). Different from her malfunctioning brother, she is the smartest student during her school time, and has better skills in using gadgets. In a story, Nobita is intent on replacing Doraemon with Dorami due to her better skills; however, he quickly learns the fact that Dorami does not understand him as much as Doraemon does and will not tolerate his usual antics. Dorami also has her own spin-off manga. In the manga series The Doraemons, she is the love interest of Dora-the-Kid, Doraemon's friendly rival and the one most similar to him. Allegedly, she was originally pink, but turned yellow after drinking a potion labeled "Jealousy".

						<li id="mini"><h2>Mini-Doras</h2></li>
						<p>
							Voiced by: Chie Kitagawa (1990), Rei Sakuma (1994~March 2005), Tomato Akai (October 2005~) (Japanese); Cristina Vee (2014) (English)
						</p>
						<p>
							Mini-Doras (ミニドラ[たち]) are one of the gadgets of Doraemon. They are mini-versions of Doraemon with different color variation such as red, green and yellow variations. They can think and feel for themselves, and communicate with Doraemon through the "Mini-Dora" language (consisting of words like Dorara and speaking with gibberish accent). They act as helpers for all sorts of tasks, such as repairing the internal mechanism of Doraemon. Only Doraemon can understand the language of Mini-Doras
